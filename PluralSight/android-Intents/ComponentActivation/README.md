# Component Activation
This app will use intents to create instance of components of various type i.e
Activity,Service,Broadcast Reciever

## Addtional Features
* Use single intent to create activity instance and prevent multiple instance's of the activity from being created by multiple intent.Rather once the activity is created by one intent use the other intents to use same activity instance
* Listen to system's **airplane notification** and incorporate that in the app
* Add logging to indicate process and thread running using the component
* Have intent filter's in *AndroidManifest.XML* for various components

## Development Updates

* Added functionality to call service explicitly

## Doubts and question
* use of constructor vs onCreate in service?

* issue when calling service explicitly
* not seeing reciever work when app is not running
